        The intercept feature gracefully takes a person''s phone out of service, while
        providing callers with informative announcements and alternative routing options.
        Depending on the service configuration, none, some, or all incoming calls
        to the specified person are intercepted. Also depending on the service configuration,
        outgoing calls are intercepted or rerouted to another location.

        The intercept feature gracefully takes a person''s phone out of service, while
        providing callers with informative announcements and alternative routing options.
        Depending on the service configuration, none, some, or all incoming calls
        to the specified person are intercepted. Also depending on the service configuration,
        outgoing calls are intercepted or rerouted to another location.
