    Guest Management

    Guests in Webex are users with only a temporary identity and are often used for single-transaction collaborations.
    Examples include click-to-call and click-to-chat applications where the guest interacts with the agent only for
    the duration of the call or chat session.
    Guests in Webex are created and managed via a Service App with the scope guest-issuer:write and guest-issuer:read
    and are represented by a token with a fixed and predefined set of scopes.

    Since the Service App manages its own pool of guests, you need to insert the Service App token into the developer
    portal's Try-It mode rather than your default personal token.

    The `guests/token` endpoint is used to create and retrieve guest tokens, and the `guests/count` is used to assess
    the number of current guests.

    Creating guests via the guest-issuer application type is deprecated and will
    be removed in the future.

        Create a Guest

        Create a new token for a single guest user. The Service App that creates the guest must have the scope
        `guest-issuer:write`.

        Guests are implicitly created by retrieving the guest access token.

        Repeated calls to this API with the same `subject` will create additional tokens without invalidating previous
        ones. Tokens are valid until the `expiresIn`.

        Guests can be renamed by supplying the same `subject` and changing the `displayName.`

        To retrieve a new token for an existing guest, please provide the existing guest's `subject`. Tokens are valid
        until `expiresIn`.
