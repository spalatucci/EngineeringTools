      Webex Calling Organization Settings support reading and writing of Webex Calling
      settings for a specific organization.

      Viewing these read-only organization settings requires a full or read-only administrator
      auth token with a scope of spark-admin:telephony_config_read, as the current

      utilizing People Webex Calling APIs.

      Modifying these organization settings requires a full administrator auth token
      with a scope of spark-admin:telephony_config_write.

      A partner administrator can retrieve or change settings in a customer''s organization
      using the optional OrgId query parameter.'

        Call queues temporarily hold calls in the cloud when all agents, which

        can be users or agents, assigned to receive calls from the queue are

        unavailable. Queued calls are routed to an available agent when not on an

        active call. Each call queue is assigned a Lead Number, which is a telephone

        number outside callers can dial to reach users assigned to the call queue.

        Call queues are also assigned an internal extension, which can be dialed

        internally to reach users assigned to the call queue.

        Retrieving call queue details requires a full or read-only administrator auth
        token with a scope of spark-admin:telephony_config_read.'

        Call queues temporarily hold calls in the cloud when all agents, which

        can be users or agents, assigned to receive calls from the queue are

        unavailable. Queued calls are routed to an available agent when not on an

        active call. Each call queue is assigned a Lead Number, which is a telephone

        number outside callers can dial to reach users assigned to the call queue.

        Call queues are also assigned an internal extension, which can be dialed

        internally to reach users assigned to the call queue.

        Updating a call queue requires a full administrator auth token with a scope
        of spark-admin:telephony_config_write.'
