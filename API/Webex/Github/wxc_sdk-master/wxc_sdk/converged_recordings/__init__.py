    Converged Recordings

    Not supported for Webex for Government (FedRAMP)

    Webex Meetings and Webex Calling (with Webex as the Call Recording provider) leverage the same recording
    infrastructure. That ensures that users can use the same recording API to fetch call recordings and/or meeting
    recordings. This convergence allows the sharing of functionality (summaries, transcripts, etc.) across the Webex
    Suite and provides a consistent user experience.

    This API is currently limited to Webex Calling i.e., providing details for call recordings but will later be
    extended to include Webex Meeting recordings.

    When the recording is paused in a call, the recording does not contain the pause. If the recording is stopped and
    restarted in a call, several recordings are created. Those recordings will be consolidated and available all at
    once.

    For information on the call recording feature, refer to `Manage call recording for Webex Calling
    <https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/ilga4/Manage-call-recording-for-Webex-Calling#wbxch_t_manage-call
