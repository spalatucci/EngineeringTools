        Unanswered incoming calls cannot be transferred but can be diverted using
        the divert API.

        If the user has only two calls and wants to transfer them together, the callId1
        and callId2 parameters are optional and when not provided the calls are automatically
        selected and transferred.

        If the user has more than two calls and wants to transfer two of them together,
        the callId1 and callId2 parameters are mandatory to specify which calls are
        being transferred. Those are also commonly referred to as Attended Transfer,
        Consultative Transfer, or Supervised Transfer and will return a 204 response.

        If the user wants to transfer one call to a new destination but only when
        the destination responds, the callId1 and destination parameters are mandatory
        to specify the call being transferred and the destination.

        This is referred to as a Mute Transfer and is similar to the divert API with
        the difference of waiting for the destination to respond prior to transferring
        the call. If the destination does not respond, the call is not transferred.
        This will return a 201 response.'

        Specify the person ID in the personId parameter in the URI. Only an admin
        can update a person details.

        Include all details for the person. This action expects all user details to
        be present in the request. A common approach is to first GET the person''s
        details, make changes, then PUT both the changed and unchanged values.

        Admin users can include Webex Calling (BroadCloud) user details in the response
        by specifying callingData parameter as true.

        Note: The locationId can only be set when adding a calling license to a user.
        It cannot be changed if a user is already an existing calling user.

        When doing attendee management, to update a user from host role to an attendee
        for a site append #attendee to the respective siteUrl and remove the meeting
        host license for this site from the license array.

        To update a person from an attendee role to a host for a site, add the meeting
        license for this site in the meeting array, and remove that site from the
        siteurl parameter.

        To remove the attendee privilege for a user on a meeting site, remove the
        sitename#attendee from the siteUrls array. The showAllTypes parameter must
        be set to true.'

  Webex Calling Detailed Call History:
    doc: 'The base URL for these APIs is analytics.webexapis.com (or analytics-f.webex.com
      for Government), which does not work with the API reference''s Try It feature.
      If you have any questions or need help please contact the Webex Developer Support
      team at devsupport@webex.com.

      To retrieve Detailed Call History information, you must use a token with the
      spark-admin:calling_cdr_read scope. The authenticating user must be a read-only-admin
      or full-admin of the organization and have the administrator role "Webex Calling
      Detailed Call History API access" enabled.

      Detailed Call History information is available 5 minutes after a call has ended
      and may be retrieved for up to 48 hours. For example, if a call ends at 9:46
      am, the record for that call can be collected using the API from 9:51 am, and
      is available until 9:46 am two days later.

      This API is rate-limited to one call every 5 minutes for a given organization
      ID.

      Details on the fields returned from this API and their potential values are
      available at https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/nmug598/Reports-for-Your-Cloud-Collaboration-Portfolio.
      Select the Report templates tab, and then in the Webex Calling reports section
      see Calling Detailed Call History Report.'

        unavailable. Queued calls are routed to an available agent when not on an

        active call. Each call queue is assigned a Lead Number, which is a telephone

        number outside callers can dial to reach users assigned to the call queue.

        Call queues are also assigned an internal extension, which can be dialed

        internally to reach users assigned to the call queue.

        action.

        Retrieving schedule details requires a full or read-only administrator auth
        token with a scope of spark-admin:telephony_config_read.'

        The intercept feature gracefully takes a person''s phone out of service, while
        providing callers with informative announcements and alternative routing options.
        Depending on the service configuration, none, some, or all incoming calls
        to the specified person are intercepted. Also depending on the service configuration,
        outgoing calls are intercepted or rerouted to another location.

        The intercept feature gracefully takes a workspace''s phone out of service,
        while providing callers with informative announcements and alternative routing
        options. Depending on the service configuration, none, some, or all incoming
        calls to the specified workspace are intercepted. Also depending on the service
        configuration, outgoing calls are intercepted or rerouted to another location.

    - doc: 'Configures a Workspace''s Call Intercept Settings

        The intercept feature gracefully takes a workspace''s phone out of service,
        while providing callers with informative announcements and alternative routing
        options. Depending on the service configuration, none, some, or all incoming
        calls to the specified person are intercepted. Also depending on the service
        configuration, outgoing calls are intercepted or rerouted to another location.

        This API requires a full or read-only administrator auth token with a scope
        of spark-admin:workspaces_write or a user auth token with spark:workspaces_read
        scope can be used by a person to read their settings.'
